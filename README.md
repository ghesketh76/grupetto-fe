# Grupetto Web App Frontend

## General Info

Welcome to Grupetto! The number one place to organize group rides with you fellow cyclists! On the app you will be able to create an account, at which point you will be able to access the main page in which all the group ride happenings are posted along with a map of their starting points. You will be able to post your own group ride, and modify that post as need be (but only your own posts!). You are also able to join existing rides and see the amount of people planning to be in attendance.


What does Grupetto mean? Well in bike racing it is a group of cyclists who form a large group behind the leading peloton. Generally formed on mountain stages when non-climbers can't keep up and drop off the back of the peloton during the climb. These riders are generally sprinters or domestiques unconcerned about their finishing positions in the mountain stages. So join that grupetto and just get out there!
